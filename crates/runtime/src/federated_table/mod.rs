//! A representation of a federated table in Spice.
//!
//! A federated table is mainly just a wrapper around an `Arc<dyn TableProvider>`. However,
//! in the event that we cannot connect to the table provider, we can create a task
//! to keep trying to connect to the table provider until it is available.
//!
//! Combined with the ability to retrieve the schema of the table from an existing acceleration,
//! this allows us to register accelerated tables and serve data from them while waiting
//! for the table provider to become available.
//!
//! Unlike the `AcceleratedTable` struct, this struct does not implement the `TableProvider` trait itself.
//! It only provides a way to get the underlying table provider and schema.
